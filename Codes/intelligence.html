                Wolves and big cats all exhibit remarkable intelligence, but their cognitive abilities differ based on their social structures and natural behaviors.
                Wolves are highly intelligent animals, known for their complex social dynamics and ability to work cooperatively within their packs. Their problem-solving skills and
                communication methods, such as vocalizations and body language, reflect their need for coordination in hunting and maintaining pack hierarchy. Lions, while also social,
                rely on simpler group dynamics within their prides, using teamwork primarily in hunting. Their intelligence is evident in their strategic hunting techniques and
                ability to adapt to their environment. Tigers, being solitary by nature, display a different kind of intelligence, excelling in stealth, patience, and strategic
                planning during hunts. They are also known for their ability to learn and adapt to changing circumstances, especially in captivity. While all three species demonstrate
                advanced cognitive abilities, wolves' social intelligence stands out, while lions and tigers showcase impressive problem-solving and hunting strategies tailored to
                their respective lifestyles.
