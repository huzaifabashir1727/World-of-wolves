                The phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf C. lupus from the earlier C. mosbachensis (which in turn descended from C. etruscus) is widely accepted.Among the oldest
                fossils of the modern grey wolf is from Ponte Galeria in Italy, dating to 406,500 ± 2,400 years ago.[15] Remains from Cripple Creek Sump in Alaska may be considerably
                older, around 1 million years old,though differentiating between the remains of modern wolves and C. mosbachensis is difficult and ambiguous, with some authors
                choosing to include C. mosbachensis (which first appeared around 1.4 million years ago) as an early subspecies of C. lupus.
                
                Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the Late Pleistocene. Many Late Pleistocene wolf populations had more robust skulls and teeth than modern
                wolves, often with a shortened snout, a pronounced development of the temporalis muscle, and robust premolars. It is proposed that these features were specialized 
                adaptations for the processing of carcass and bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of Pleistocene megafauna. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene
                wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage similar to that seen in the extinct dire wolf. This suggests they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed
                with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey quickly. The frequency and location of tooth fractures in these wolves indicates they were habitual bone
                crackers like the modern spotted hyena.
                
                Genomic studies suggest modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population.A 2021 study found that the Himalayan wolf and the
                Indian plains wolf are part of a lineage that is basal to other wolves and split from them 200,000 years ago.Other wolves appear to share most of their common
                ancestry much more recently, within the last 23,000 years (around the peak and the end of the Last Glacial Maximum), originating from Siberia or Beringia.
                While some sources have suggested that this was a consequence of a population bottleneck,other studies have suggested that this a result of gene flow
                homogenising ancestry.
                
                A 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the divergence of the lineage that led to dogs from other
                Old World wolves around 11,100–12,300 years ago.[20] An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,with the dog's similarity to the
                extant wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.The dingo, Basenji, Tibetan Mastiff and Chinese indigenous breeds are basal members of the
                domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World
                wolves, the Mexican wolf diverged around 5,400 years ago.
