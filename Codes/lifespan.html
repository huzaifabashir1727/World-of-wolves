        The lifespan of wolves, lions, and tigers varies depending on whether they live in the wild or captivity. Wolves typically live 6 to 8 years in the wild due to
        threats like injury, disease, and human conflict, but in captivity, they can live up to 12 to 16 years with proper care. Lions, on the other hand, have a lifespan of 
        10 to 15 years in the wild, with males often living shorter lives due to territorial conflicts and injuries, while in captivity, they can live up to 20 years or more.
        Tigers share a similar lifespan, living 10 to 15 years in the wild, where poaching and habitat loss pose significant risks, but they can reach 20 to 25 years in 
        captivity with access to consistent food and medical care. While wolves tend to have shorter lifespans than lions and tigers, captivity significantly extends the life
        expectancy of all three species by providing a safe and stable environment free from natural threats.
