                                Among the types of wolves that live in cold areas, there is the Canis lupus albus, popularly known as the Tundra wolf or Siberian wolf. It mainly lives in the Russian
                                tundra and the Siberian region until it reaches Scandinavia. It weighs between 88 and 110 lbs and its fur is long and thick and allows it to survive in extremely cold
                                temperatures.
                            </p>
                            <p>    
                                The Tundra wolf feeds on reindeer, hares and arctic foxes. In addition, it is a nomadic species that travels following the migrations of the animals that form part of
                                its diet.

                                Another breed of wolf is the Arabian wolf (Canis lupus arabs), a subspecies of the grey wolf found in the Sinai Peninsula and several Middle Eastern countries. It is
                                a small desert wolf that weighs only 44 lbs and feeds on carrion as well as smaller animals such as hares.

                                Unlike other wolves, the Arabian wolf does not howl and does not live in packs. Its coat is sepia with brown, two colors that allow it to camouflage itself perfectly
                                in sand and rocky areas.

                                The steppe wolf (Canis lupus campestris) is a subspecies of the grey wolf that lives in the steppes and deserts of Russia, the Caucasus and Central Asia. Also known
                                as the Caspian Sea wolf, it is relatively smaller than its congener the common grey wolf, and its fur is denser, thinner and shorter.

                                It is considered to be a single subspecies with the Caucasian wolf (Canis lupus cubanensis) and the desert wolf (Canis lupus desertorum).

                                The Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus chanco), or Mongolian wolf, lives in Mongolia, northern and central China, and Korea. It is also found in the region of Oussouri in 
                                Russia, which it is said to have conquered from China, fleeing humans and taking advantage of the disappearance of the other great predator of the region, the tiger.

                                In Mongolia, the wolf permeates legends and is considered a totem animal. For wolf, Mongolians say "chono". A separate subspecies of the Mongolian wolf has been 
                                proposed and then rejected for individuals living in Korea (Canis lupus coreanus), which has a finer snout.

                                Canus lupus arctos, or Arctic wolf, is an endemic specimen of Canada and Greenland. Its size is smaller than that of other wolves and it weighs around 99 lbs.
                                As a form of adaptation to its icy environment where it lives, it has a white or light yellow fur that allows it to camouflage itself perfectly. It is also
                                a subspecies of Canis Lupus.

                                This species tends to live in rock caves and it feeds on other mammals that live in arctic areas, such as elk, beef and caribou, as well as seals and partridges.

                                Another breed of wolf is the Canis lupus baileyi, a subspecies that lives in North America, where it prefers to live in deserts and temperate forest zones.
                                The mexican wolf weighs up to 99 lbs and its fur is of several colors, among which are cream, yellow and black.

                                This species feeds on cattle, hares, sheep and rodents. Due to the fact that it attacks cattle, it was hunted and nowadays it is considered extinct in the wild,
                                however, there are some programs for its reproduction in captivity.

                                Canis lupus columbianus was one of the largest subspecies of grey wolves in North America. They weighed between 36 and 68 kg, and had long hairs that were usually 
                                black, often mixed with grey or brown. They were about 1.52 to 1.78 m long.

                            The Vancouver Island wolf, or, Canis lupus crassodon is endemic to Vancouver Island in Canada. Like the arctic wolf, it has a white coat that allows it to camouflage 
                            itself in its environment. Although not much is known about this type of wolf, it is known to live in packs of up to 35 individuals and rarely approaches areas
                            populated by humans.

                                The wolf of the Kenai Peninsula was the largest wolf in North America before men exterminated it. It was identified as a subspecies Canis lupus alces in 1941 by senior
                                biologist Edward Goldman based on skeletal findings.

                                The Newfoundland wolf subspecies (Canis lupus beothucus) was not officially described until 1937 by zooligists G.M. Allen and Thomas Barbour, after it had already been
                                threatened with extinction. Its scientific name Canis lupus beothucus comes from the Beothuck, the native Newfoundlanders who were officially declared extinct in 1829.

                                The Newfoundland wolf lived on the island of Newfoundland off the east coast of Canada. Recent evidence has suggested that the first wolves to inhabit the island may
                                have been there before the last ice age, surviving the ice age in refuges south of the ice cap.

                                The Bernard's wolf resided on the Isle of Banks in Canada's Northwest Territories. It used to exist in the Victoria Archipelago but was eradicated by over-hunting.

                                The skin of an adult male and a skull of the Bernard's wolf had been deposited at the National Museum of Canada by explorer Peter Bernard, and it was decided to name
